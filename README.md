# Kyle Gates' Portfolio


This Webpage is a portfolio for Kyle Gates. It includes an about me, contact, and portfolio gallery pages.
It also includes a navbar to each of the pages, and a footer. This page is also mobile friendly, and was coded

The about me page includes a profile image, two paragraphs(One for education and work history, and one for interest and hobbies), and a section of goals.
