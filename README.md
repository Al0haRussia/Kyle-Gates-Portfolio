# Kyle Gates' Portfolio


This Webpage is a portfolio for Kyle Gates. It includes an about me, contact, and portfolio gallery pages.
It also includes a navbar to each of the pages, and a footer. This page is also mobile friendly, and was coded 
using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.

The about me page includes a profile image, two paragraphs(One for education and work history, and one for interest and hobbies), and a section of goals.

The contact page includes three prompts; your email address, your name, and any message you wish to include, which all are submitted via the submit button at the bottom of these three prompts. There is also a section dedicated to other forms of media as well.
